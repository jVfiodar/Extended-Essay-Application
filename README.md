# Extended-Essay-Application
  I am Fiodar. A discipline "Extended Essay" was a part of the International Diploma curriculum. It is a small research in a topic of the student's choice.
  My topic is: "Use and implementation of algorithms connected with graph theory for calculating optimal 
(in terms of spent time, price, number of transfers or a combination of these criteria) commuting routes".
  My aim is to create a model network based on stations and public transport routes that operate in and close to Leiden, 
and create a application which computes the optimal routes between stations. 
  This repository contains the application itself, the files necessary for its successful execution, including timetables,
and an automaton that was used to extract timetables from the original sources.
